# Sudoku-Solver
Sudoku is a puzzle game that requires the player to complete a 9x9 grid of numbers so that every row, column, and 3x3 subgrids contain every number within the 1-9 range.

This program accepts a 2D-array that represents the puzzle itself. Empty spaces should be represented by '0's. 

Example of 2D puzzle array: 

puzzle = [
  [8, 0, 6, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 1],
  [2, 0, 0, 0, 8, 4, 9, 0, 3],
  [0, 0, 0, 5, 0, 9, 0, 0, 6],
  [0, 0, 3, 9, 5, 0, 0, 2, 0],
  [0, 7, 1, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [9, 2, 0, 1, 0, 0, 7, 5, 0],
  [4, 5, 7, 0, 9, 0, 3, 0, 0],
  [0, 6, 0, 0, 0, 0, 8, 9, 5],
  [0, 0, 0, 2, 3, 5, 0, 6, 0]
]
